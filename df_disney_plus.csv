                      In 1996, the once-dominant New York Islanders were in serious trouble. Lousy performance and poor management were driving away the hockey franchise's loyal fan base.

                      On August 9, 1988, the NHL was forever changed with the single stroke of a pen. The Edmonton Oilers, fresh off their fourth Stanley Cup victory in five years, signed a deal that sent Wayne Gretzky, a Canadian national treasure and the greatest hockey player ever to play the game, to the Los Angeles Kings in a multiplayer, multimillion-dollar deal. As bewildered Oilers fans struggled to make sense of the unthinkable, fans in Los Angeles were rushing to purchase season tickets at a rate so fast it overwhelmed the Kings' box office. Overnight, a franchise largely overlooked in its 21-year existence was suddenly playing to sellout crowds and standing ovations, and a league often relegated to ""little brother"" status exploded from 21 teams to 30 in less than a decade. Acclaimed director Peter Berg presents the captivating story of the trade that knocked the wind out of an entire country, and placed a star-studded city right at the humble feet of a 27-year-old kid, known simply as ""The Great One.""

In each episode, a family takes a full week away from their busy schedules to go on a journey to reconnect and rebuild their family bonds. Leaving their phones, laptops, and all other devices behind, they must find their way to their week-long accomodations the “old fashioned waywith just a paper map in hand. On arrival, they’re greeted by their “Family Reboot” guide, who welcomes them to their journey and directs them to their first activity, finding the key to their house for the week. Once the families have gotten inside and have chosen the rooms they must share, the guide talks to the parents about how the week ahead can benefit them the most, whether it’s finding ways to connect with their children, with each other or both. For the next several days, it’s more fun and games interspersed with meaningful conversations that the families typically haven’t had time to have. All organized by the guide, the week’s journey focuses on working together, communicating, and most of all having fun, reminding the family to put aside their distractions and busy schedules to come together again and make new memories. The families leave the journey completely “rebooted” – more connected, happier, and ready to take on their busy lives at home again, but with an entirely new outlook.

It is the site of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the home of the Indians, the Browns and the Cavaliers. But it's also the home of an agonizing losing streak. Of all American cities that have at least three major sports franchises, Cleveland is the only one that has failed to win a championship in the last half-century. Those sports teams, and the hearts they've broken over and over again, have inspired a different name for the city, and the title for this 30 for 30 film: ""Believeland.""

But a special debt of gratitude is owed to two half-brothers, whose courage two decades ago paved the way for their stardom. ""Brothers in Exile"" tells the incredible story of Livan and Orlando ""El Duque"" Hernandez, who risked their lives to get off the island. Livan left first, banking on his status as the hottest young prospect in Cuba he defected via Mexico and signed with the Florida Marlins, for whom he became one of the youngest World Series MVPs in history in 1997. Staying behind was Orlando, who was banned from professional baseball in Cuba for life because he was suspected of having helped Livan escape.

                      By the mid-1980s Paul Westhead had worn out his welcome in the NBA. The best offer he could find came from an obscure small college with little history of basketball. In the same city where he had won an NBA championship with Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Westhead was determined to perfect his non-stop run-and-gun offensive system at Loyola Marymount. His shoot-first offense appeared doomed to fail until Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble, two talented players from Westhead's hometown of Philadelphia, arrived gift-wrapped at his doorstep. With Gathers and Kimble leading a record scoring charge, Westhead's system suddenly dazzled the world of college basketball and turned conventional thinking on its head. But then, early in the 1989-90 season, Gathers collapsed during a game and was diagnosed with an abnormal heartbeat. Determined to play, Gathers returned three games later, but less than three months later, he tragically died on the court. Working with both Westhead and Kimble, Oscar-winning director Bill Couturié tells a fast-paced and emotionally moving story of innovation, triumph and tragedy.

                      He made perhaps the most dramatic shot in the history of the NCAA basketball tournament. He's the only player to start in four consecutive Final Fours, and was instrumental in Duke winning two national championships. He had looks, smarts and game. So why has Christian Laettner been disliked so intensely by so many for so long? Maybe it was the time he stomped on the chest of a downed player, or the battles he had with his teammates, or a perceived sense of entitlement. But sometimes, perception isn't reality. ""I Hate Christian Laettner"" will go beyond the polarizing persona to reveal the complete story behind this lightning rod of college basketball. Featuring extensive access to Laettner, previously unseen footage and perspectives from all sides, this film will be a ""gloves-off"" examination of the man who has been seen by many as the ""Blue Devil Himself.

Led by a Nigerian soccer player named Hakeem Olajuwon and a lightly recruited hometown kid named Clyde Drexler, the University of Houston Cougars not only electrified the NCAA Final Four with three straight appearances (1982-84), but they also helped transform the game itself. In this 30 for 30 film, director Chip Rives (""Brian and The Boz"") brings back the high-flying circus act under ringmaster Guy V. Lewis and spins a tale of true greatness and crushing heartbreak. But while exploring that larger narrative, Rives also focuses on the disappearance of enigmatic role player Benny Anders and the lasting brotherhood that compels teammates and 1981-82 co-captains Eric Davis and Lynden Rose to try and find him after more than two decades of mystery.

                      Winner of the Best Documentary Critics Choice Award as well as the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, SUMMER OF SOUL (…OR, WHEN THE REVOLUTION COULD NOT BE TELEVISED) is an exhilarating experience. In his acclaimed debut as a filmmaker, Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson presents this powerful and transporting documentary that’s part music film and part historical record, created around an epic event that celebrated Black history, culture and fashion. Over the course of six weeks in the summer of 1969, just one hundred miles south of Woodstock, The Harlem Cultural Festival was filmed in Mount Morris Park (now called Marcus Garvey Park). The footage was largely forgotten – until now. SUMMER OF SOUL shines a light on the importance of history to our spiritual well-being and stands as a testament to the healing power of music during times of unrest, both past and present. The film includes concert performances by music legends Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Sly & the Family Stone, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Mahalia Jackson, B.B. King, The 5th Dimension and more.

                      The story of one of the greatest upsets in sports history has been told. Or has it? On a Friday evening in Lake Placid, New York, a plucky band of American collegians stunned the vaunted Soviet national team, 4-3 in the medal round of the 1980 Winter Olympic hockey competition. Americans couldn't help but believe in miracles that night, and when the members of Team USA won the gold medal two days later, they became a team for the ages. But there was another, unchronicled side to the ""Miracle On Ice."" The so-called bad guys from America's ideological adversary were in reality good men and outstanding players, forged into the Big Red Machine by the genius and passion of Anatoli Tarasov. There was a reason they seemed unbeatable, especially after routing the Americans in an exhibition the week before the Winter Games began. And there was a certain shame in them having to live the rest of their lives with the results of Feb. 22, 1980.In the 30 for 30 film ""Of Miracles and Men,"" director Jonathan Hock (""The Best That Never Was"" and ""Survive and Advance"") explores the scope of the ""Miracle on Ice"" through the Soviet lens. His intense focus on the game itself gives it renewed suspense and a fresh perspective. But the journey of the stunned Soviet team didn't begin – or end – in Lake Placid.

                      Brash. Electric. Magnetic. It would be hard to find another athlete whose brilliance on the field was such a manifestation of his persona beyond it as Deion Sanders. Sure, there were other stars who played more than one sport, and there were other figures whose individuality got your attention - but there was no one who did it quite like the man who loved the spotlight so much, he called himself ""Prime Time."" And there was no instance that encapsulated his abilities, and his conviction in how limitless they were, more spectacularly than a whirlwind 24 hours in October of 1992 - when Sanders sandwiched a pro football game around a pair of postseason baseball games, in two different cities a thousand miles apart. Now, in the upcoming 30 for 30 film Deion's Double Play, NFL Films and director Ken Rodgers along with SMAC Entertainment tell the story of an incredible feat of athleticism - and logistics - starting in Pittsburgh, where Sanders was with the Braves for the National League Championship Series, continuing to Miami, when he played for the Falcons the next day, and returning back to Pittsburgh, where he joined the Braves again that night. It was a race against time, and a stunt in the minds of some. But beneath all the controversy, audacity, and brio, it was also an incredible athlete trying to reconcile a love for two sports at once.

                      Among The Stars is a character-led six-part docuseries following astronaut Captain Chris Cassidy on a quest to get back in his spacesuit for one last mission. The mission? A series of complex spacewalks to repair a $2 billion science experiment: the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). But when Chris is taken off the mission, his partner Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano must step up with NASA astronaut and first-time flier Drew Morgan. Whilst Luca and Drew launch to the International Space Station, the team on the ground are under pressure to finalize the spacewalk tools in time. Any astronaut will tell you they’re just the tip of the iceberg, and that a successful mission relies on a team made up of engineers, flight controllers and specialists of all varieties. The four AMS spacewalks unfold in a dramatic fashion. Meanwhile, Chris gets charged with a new mission to return to the International Space Station as Commander and sole representative of America and its partners - the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). His training takes him to Russia, Japan and Germany, before launching amidst the chaos of COVID-19. On board he ushers in a new era of space travel with the arrival of SpaceX and finally gets to exit the hatch himself on a series of spacewalks to keep the station alive. The series captures the last bastion of the old era of space travel through Shuttle astronauts like Chris, and traverses into what the future holds with NASA’s plans to return to the Moon and its new commercial partnerships pushing the agencies further and faster into deep space.

                      At Pixar Animation Studios, SparkShorts filmmakers are given six months and minimal resources to assemble a team and create a short animated film. No major rules apply – filmmakers are driven by their need to tell a story and the nimble approach to do so. ""A Spark Story"" introduces Aphton Corbin and Louis Gonzales, two filmmakers striving to get their uniquely personal SparkShorts visions on screen. Each, teamed with a producer, navigates the emotional rollercoaster of stepping into a leadership role and inspiring their crew. Corbin’s film, “Twenty Something,” required novel approaches to storytelling to convey one character's multiple perspectives – all using hand-drawn animation (a rarity for Pixar). Gonzales’ film, “Nona,” came from an intensely personal place, but that didn’t stop a serious bout of writer's block from nearly derailing the entire production. Produced in collaboration with Pixar, ""A Spark Story"" comes from Supper Club (“Chef’s Table”) and directors Jason Sterman and Leanne Dare. The documentary will give audiences an exclusive and immersive look at the filmmakers and their short films, while also exploring the creative philosophy that makes Pixar unique. Jason Sterman, Brian McGinn and David Gelb produce.

                      Goofy’s back in a trio of all-new, hand-drawn animated shorts offering comical insights on “Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home” with such topics as mastering the skills of “How to Wear a Mask,” “Learning to Cook,” and “Binge Watching.” Like most of the world, Goofy – the clumsy, charismatic and lovable Disney “everyman” character who has entertained and “educated” audiences from his screen debut in 1932, his breakout solo short, “Goofy and Wilbur” (1939), a series of popular “how to” shorts in the '40s, to career highlights including “A Goofy Movie” (1995), and the 2007 short “How to Hook Up Your Home Theater” – spent the last year and a half staying at home. So it seemed only natural to acclaimed master animator/director Eric Goldberg (“Aladdin,” “Pocahontas,” “Fantasia/2000,” “Moana”) that Goofy could provide some good-natured lessons in “How to Stay at Home” and demonstrate how to make the best of today’s challenging situations. Goldberg directed all three of the films in this series and was the supervising animator on “How to Wear a Mask.” Joining him were fellow Disney veterans/supervising animators Mark Henn (“Binge Watching”) and Randy Haycock (“Learning to Cook”). The “Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home” series is produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios veteran/Emmy Award®-winner Dorothy McKim (“Meet the Robinsons,” the “Prep & Landing” television specials, and the Oscar®-nominated short, “Get a Horse!”). Bill Farmer, the voice of Goofy since 1987, provides the familiar vocals for the character, and versatile actor, Corey Burton, is heard as the narrator.

Wolfgang overcame a difficult childhood, and soon envisioned a life for himself beyond the Austrian countryside. At the age of 14, Wolfgang started his formal culinary training in Paris, and made his mark in the kitchens of some of France’s most famous restaurants.

Wolfgang’s restaurant, the world-famous Spago, became a destination for the rich and famous, with Wolfgang as the star attraction.

Wolfgang Puck is now credited as the first “celebrity chef,” and has opened dozens of restaurants throughout the United States.

From that moment on, Tyler and Avery agree on one thing: Stan’s ability to speak must be kept a secret from everyone, even their parents. As the kids learn to work together to keep Stan’s secret safe, they soon find that his canine point of view, whether in the home, in the yard or in the park, helps them navigate their new sibling situation and, ultimately, becomes the tie that binds the family.

Myth: A Frozen Tale;2021;TV-G;12 min;['Animation', 'Family', 'Fantasy'];February 26, 2021;5.5/10;"A family sits down for a bedtime story and is transported to a forest filled with elemental spirits.                                        
                      Inspired by the exciting environments, themes and elemental characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios’ Frozen 2, acclaimed director Jeff Gipson (Cycles) brings to life this imaginative and vibrant tale set in an enchanted forest outside of Arendelle. A family gathering for an evening of bedtime stories sets the stage for a magnificent adventure to a colorful and mythical world, which includes close encounters with the Nokk (a water spirit in the form of a mighty stallion), Gale (the playful wind spirit who can manifest as a light breeze or a raging tornado-like force), the Earth Giants (the massive creatures that form the rocky riverbanks and are capable of intense destruction when awakened), and the Fire Spirit (a fast-moving and mercurial salamander named Bruni). As the story unfolds, these spirits come to life and the myth of their past and future is revealed. Production designer Brittney Lee drew upon the Studios’ legacy of great artists (Eyvind Earle, Mary Blair, and Frozen’s own production designer Michael Giaimo) along with her own instincts to create a visual landscape that was unique in its colors, shapes and style. Just as Disney’s musical milestone, Fantasia, combined the power of music with striking visuals, producer Nicholas Russell and director Gipson, enlisted composer Joseph Trapanese (Tron: Legacy) to help them enhance the experience for Myth: A Frozen Tale. Evan Rachel Wood (the voice of Queen Iduna in Frozen 2) lends her voice as the narrator of the film. Finally, Myth is a tip of the hat to Gipson’s own family tradition of telling bedtime stories, including a particular story passed down from his great-great-great grandfather about a brush with the outlaw Jesse James when he was a young farm boy growing up near Kansas City.

From the very inception of comic books, secret identities have been an integral part of both superheroes and villains leading “normal” lives.

Since the advent of the Marvel Age of Comics in the early 1960s, Marvel’s writers and artists have used the notion of identities to examine the evolving concept of equal rights. These legendary Marvel creations and stories have not only reflected the world outside our window – they have become a reflection of our own identities and who we truly are.

At a time in life when everyone is trying to understand who they are and what they ultimately want, Bia and her friends embark on these quests. They sing, dance, create videos and work together to fulfill their dreams. The biggest challenge ahead is figuring out what each individual really wants and once they discover it, they must learn how to pursue it while being true to themselves. Different from Laix's philosophy, a digital network where the talents are willing to do anything for more followers and fame, the Fundom group will face disappointments and fall but get back on their feet several times, guided by the principle that real success is finding happiness by being yourself. BIA is music, mystery, romance, all entwined with the rhythm of social media networks.

The Real Right Stuff;2020;TV-PG;90 min;['Documentary', 'Historical'];November 20, 2020;7.1/10;"The Real Right Stuff tells the story of the nation’s first astronauts.                                        
                      In 1961, NASA successfully sent its first astronaut into space, restoring the world’s faith in the US space program. Now, nearly six decades later, the human spirit for exploration remains as fervent as ever. The Real Right Stuff traces back to the very beginning, as the nation’s first astronauts – famously known as the Original Mercury 7 – become overnight heroes during the high-stakes era of the space race. A companion piece to Disney+ and National Geographic’s scripted series, The Right Stuff, this new documentary from Emmy and Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Tom Jennings (“Apollo: Missions to the Moon,” “Diana: In Her Own Words”) is based on Tom Wolfe’s bestselling book of the same name. Jennings uses his signature style of first-person storytelling to create a gripping account of NASA’s Project Mercury program, which revolutionized America’s role in space exploration. Told from Wolfe’s point of view and through the perspectives of the Mercury astronauts, the two-hour special catapults viewers back to the late 1950s and tells the remarkable story that inspired future generations of space enthusiasts. Free of modern-day narration and interviews, The Real Right Stuff interlaces archival news and radio reports, newly transferred and previously unheard NASA mission audio recordings, and rare and unseen material to immerse viewers in one of the most dramatic and tenacious periods in American history.

                      Based on the iconic bestseller by Tom Wolfe, The Right Stuff is an inspirational look at the early days of the U.S. Space Program and the incredible story of America’s first astronauts, the Mercury Seven. At the height of the Cold War in 1959, the Soviet Union dominates the space race, and America fears it is a nation in decline. Newly-formed NASA has the monumental task of sending a man into space, and its engineers estimate they need decades to accomplish the feat. They are given two years. Dubbed Project Mercury, the program recruits and trains just seven astronauts from a handful of the military’s best pilots. Within days of being presented to the world, the Mercury Seven become instant celebrities, forged into heroes before they achieve a single heroic act. At a time when many wondered if America’s glory days were behind it, The Right Stuff is an aspirational story about how ordinary human beings can achieve the extraordinary. As much about who we are today as it is about historic achievements, the series evokes the wonder of this singular era, when the free world looked towards a new horizon of hope as we first stepped off the bounds of our only home to venture into the vast unknown.

                      Diving With Dolphins chronicles the making of Disneynature’s Dolphin Reef, the story of a young Pacific bottlenose dolphin named Echo. From wave surfing with dolphins in South Africa to dancing with humpback whales in Hawaii, filmmakers go to great lengths - and depths - to shed new light on the ocean’s mysteries. To locate and “cast” their lead and supporting characters, Disneynature filmmakers partner with marine life experts and scientists, traveling to stunning locations such as the Red Sea, French Polynesia, Sipadan Island in Malaysia and the islands of Palau. On their global aquatic journey, the team captures remarkable bottlenose dolphin behaviors rarely seen in the wild, including a little-known ritual involving gorgonian coral, synchronized swimming while sleeping, and a fascinating, cooperative hunting strategy called mud ringing. The crew, many of whom have filmed marine animals for decades, faced some unusual underwater challenges. How do you safely capture underwater footage of massive male humpbacks battling over a female? How can you smoothly track tiny, fast-moving reef residents like the cleaner wrasse? Filmmakers reveal their clever solutions. And while cinematographers experience many moments that take their breath away, a few assignments - including an eerie expedition into a coral reef catacomb and a nighttime dive with hundreds of hunting sharks - have the entire crew holding their breath. After three years in production, filmmakers are hopeful their quest will have a meaningful and lasting impact on audiences. They take one last trip, not featured in the final film, which illustrates how humans can positively impact our oceans and their incredible inhabitants long into the future. Explorer Céline Cousteau narrates the English-language version.

Dolphin Reef;2018;G;78 min;['Animals & Nature', 'Documentary', 'Family'];April 3, 2020;7.5/10;"A playful young dolphin named Echo must master his vital role in the coral reef community.                                        
                      Echo, a young Pacific bottlenose dolphin, seems far more interested in exploring his spectacular coral reef home, and its intriguing inhabitants, than learning to survive in it. He doesn’t comprehend that soon he will play a vital role in both his own survival and the survival of the colorful, living, breathing city that he and his family call home. The reef is an intricately balanced ecosystem in which each citizen contributes: from the millions of plants and creatures which inhabit the coral to the gardener fish that feed upon its lush growth to the predators – like Echo – that keep the fish population in check. At three years old, Echo has relied solely on his mother, Kumu, to feed and protect him. Now he’s weaned off mother’s milk and it’s time to catch his own meals and develop the essential skills needed to thrive in his underwater world. However, the teachings of his mother tend to go unnoticed by Echo, who’s distracted by more enjoyable pursuits. Echo often can be found balancing a shell upon his rostrom or investigating the many fascinating residents of the reef, such as the fastidious peacock mantis shrimp or the bumphead parrotfish, with a face only a mother could love. He’s particularly distracted by a 40-foot humpback whale and her newborn calf, who create a massive wake that’s hard to resist. As Echo gains more independence, he discovers that even a giant creature like the humpback whale has something to fear in the deep blue. The pod must sleep with one eye open – which, in fact, they do – with the ocean’s greatest hunter, the orca, nearby. These black-and-white behemoths prey upon bottlenose dolphins and whale calves. Even as predators themselves, the ocean contains numerous dangers for Echo and his family. They must also be wary of creatures such as the giant stingray, with its razor-sharp venomous tail, and the shark that even reef sharks fear: the tiger shark. But there’s power in numbers and Echo and his pod rely upon one another for safety and comfort. They’re a close-knit community, which communicates in a complex language of squeaks and clicks, and conveys reassurance through physical contact. The key to their survival is teamwork. Kumu is determined to make Echo a contributing member of the team and has been encouraging him to use echolocation, a highly sophisticated sonar, to find fish buried in the sand. Now it’s time for a master class. Mother and son set out on a journey to the pod’s favorite group hunting grounds, the legendary muddy shallows, where she’ll teach Echo her high-speed technique for corralling fish. If Echo can master this skill, he’ll become both self-sufficient and a valued member of the pod – a community that’s vital to the success of the reef and the health of our oceans worldwide.

                      African elephant Shani and her spirited son Jomo set out on an epic journey with their herd, traveling hundreds of miles across the vast Kalahari Desert, from the Okavango delta to the Zambezi River, just as countless generations of their ancestors have done before. Shani and her family are among the last elephants on earth to make these lengthy migrations. She’s mother to wide-eyed, one-year-old Jomo, who has yet to experience a migration, and at 40 years old, she is next in line as herd matriarch, a position currently held by her older sister Gaia. Gaia’s herd is among countless species – from hippopotamus to lechwe to baboons – that rely upon the life-giving water that flows from the mountains and transforms the heart of the desert into a green oasis known as the Okavango delta. But the season’s end is near and soon there will be a mass exodus. Nothing on Earth is more precious to life than water. And perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than the Kalahari desert in southern Africa, one of the driest places on the planet. The water is receding and paradise will soon turn to dust as the delta becomes a series of vanishing pools. Gaia instinctively knows she must lead the herd directly into the baking Kalahari desert, before the remaining water holes dry up. The herd’s success will depend on her experience and wisdom, which has been handed down over many generations. Just as the saying “an elephant never forgets” implies, these massive mammals have a deep connection to their past. Gaia will take her family down ancient elephant paths, networks of lines and circles – the circles being water holes the family will desperately need to cross the vast desert. Along the way, they’ll seek nourishment from sources such as moisture-rich mopane leaves and baobab tree trunks filled with rainwater. As they near their destination, the herd must cross the mighty Zambezi River to reach the safe haven for which they’ve been searching. They must enter the shallows, where crocodiles prey upon elephant calves like Jomo, and fight a ferocious current that could draw them into the world’s greatest waterfall, Victoria Falls. Fortunately, the herd has the strength and stamina to succeed and can rest while enjoying unlimited water and all the palm nuts they can shake from the trees. But within a few short months, food is scarce and the water begins its voyage back to the Okavango delta. The family must traverse the wilds of Africa, yet again. The march back to the delta will be no easy task, as the Angolan flood waters are early this year and the herd will need to make quick time. However, the emotional bonds between elephants are as strong as those between humans and the strength of family has gotten them this far. Together, Gaia, Shani, Jomo and family dare to take the shortest route … through lion country.

                      “In the Footsteps of Elephant” follows filmmakers as they capture the epic journey of African elephants across the Kalahari desert for Disneynature’s “Elephant.” The team faces extreme weather, inaccessible terrain, crocodile-infested waters and close encounters with lions in order to shine a light on these remarkable creatures and their ancient migrations. Filming the world’s largest terrestrial animal is no easy task. To embark on their 1,000-mile, round-trip adventure, the Disneynature team must first transport the crew, along with five tons of camera gear, to the heart of the Okavango Delta, a remote oasis where elephants gather annually. Their next challenge is finding elephants. And despite their incredible size, locating an elephant in an area that’s nearly 4,000 square miles is like finding a needle in a haystack. Fortunately for filmmakers, a local biologist who tracks elephant populations lends a hand. The team identifies its herd and it’s off the races … literally. A family of elephants can travel up to 30 miles a day on their quest to reach paradise and the crew simply can’t keep up. However, out of adversity comes opportunity. They mount a stabilized camera, normally used for aerial filming, to their truck and a whole new way of telling their story is born. Cinematographers are eager to capture a migration that’s never been shown before but filming in the African wilderness comes with its own unique set of risks. Crew members come face-to-face with crocodiles while drift diving, discover lions hunting impala in the middle of camp, and film a nighttime confrontation between a lion and a mother elephant and calf – from the open back of a truck. However, the rewards far outweigh the risks. Filmmakers reminisce about their favorite production moments. From the playful: a young calf splashing and chasing lechwes and egrets; to the poignant: an elephant herd honoring the bones of a fallen relative; to the awe-inspiring: a newborn elephant taking its first steps. After a year of filming, the team has fallen in love with the elephants, and all their unique and endearing eccentricities. When they return to where their journey began, they patiently, anxiously await the return of the herd.

Penguins: Life on the Edge;2020;G;78 min;['Animals & Nature', 'Documentary', 'Family'];April 3, 2020;6.7/10;"A witty and tenacious team of filmmakers brave the Antarctic to film Disneynature’s “Penguins.”                                        
                      “Penguins: Life on the Edge” follows the witty and tenacious team of filmmakers behind Disneynature’s “Penguins,” a coming-of-age story about an Adélie penguin named Steve. To fulfill their mission, the elite cinematographers must brave the brutal Antarctic, pushing through temperatures of -40 degrees, hurricane-strength winds and the overwhelming aroma of one million penguins. Every spring, Adélie penguins - some of the toughest birds on the planet - arrive to the edge of Antarctica to breed and ensure their species’ survival. To capture this annual ritual, the crew covers three key locations: Cape Crozer, home to the world’s largest Adélie colony; Dumont d'Urville Station, where Adélies and Emperor penguins are neighbors; and Avian Island, where no crew has filmed before. The Disneynature team has devised a unique, new look for “Penguins,” using a special camera rig to tell much of the story from a penguin’s-eye view. Intrepid divers film the Adélies’ grace and speed underwater and a helicopter crew records the massive colony and majestic scenery from above. While the team clearly admires the resilient “black-and-white miracle machines,” the penguins’ quirky behavior is often outright hilarious. Behind the scenes, filmmakers expound on comical moments, such as a tiny Adélie barging through an Emperor colony, males slyly stealing rocks from unattended nests, hungry chicks in hot pursuit of their parents, and molting mohawks. Unlike their charming subject matter, the cinematographers’ surroundings are no laughing matter. A snowstorm turns the hike back to camp into a fight for survival, katabatic winds batter the crew’s tiny tents, curious killer whales invade their personal space, and elephant seal flatulence is an assault to the senses. But perhaps nothing is more frightening than the final rite of passage for newly independent Adélie chicks. To reach open waters for the winter, they must cross brash ice where predators lie in wait. After many months of filming, crew members are positioned on land, boat and under water ready to capture the final scene … with high hopes their adorable avian acquaintances reach safety.

When Nick is about to crumble like a gingerbread cookie from all the pressure, Noelle suggests he take a break and get away to clear his head…but then he doesn’t return. His sudden disappearance leads to chaos in the North Pole, so Mrs. Kringle must step up to rein in the hi-tech replacement Santa, Cousin Gabe. Meanwhile, Noelle and Elf Polly, the family’s acerbic but good-hearted nanny, steal the sleigh and the reindeer to go in search of her brother to bring him back in time to save Christmas.
