Now, nearly six decades later, the human spirit for exploration remains as fervent as ever. The Real Right Stuff traces back to the very beginning, as the nation’s first astronauts – famously known as the Original Mercury 7 – become overnight heroes during the high-stakes era of the space race. A companion piece to Disney+ and National Geographic’s scripted series, The Right Stuff, this new documentary from Emmy and Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Tom Jennings (“Apollo: Missions to the Moon,” “Diana: In Her Own Words”) is based on Tom Wolfe’s bestselling book of the same name. Jennings uses his signature style of first-person storytelling to create a gripping account of NASA’s Project Mercury program, which revolutionized America’s role in space exploration. Told from Wolfe’s point of view and through the perspectives of the Mercury astronauts, the two-hour special catapults viewers back to the late 1950s and tells the remarkable story that inspired future generations of space enthusiasts. Free of modern-day narration and interviews, The Real Right Stuff interlaces archival news and radio reports, newly transferred and previously unheard NASA mission audio recordings, and rare and unseen material to immerse viewers in one of the most dramatic and tenacious periods in American history.

                      Diving With Dolphins chronicles the making of Disneynature’s Dolphin Reef, the story of a young Pacific bottlenose dolphin named Echo. From wave surfing with dolphins in South Africa to dancing with humpback whales in Hawaii, filmmakers go to great lengths - and depths - to shed new light on the ocean’s mysteries. To locate and “cast” their lead and supporting characters, Disneynature filmmakers partner with marine life experts and scientists, traveling to stunning locations such as the Red Sea, French Polynesia, Sipadan Island in Malaysia and the islands of Palau. On their global aquatic journey, the team captures remarkable bottlenose dolphin behaviors rarely seen in the wild, including a little-known ritual involving gorgonian coral, synchronized swimming while sleeping, and a fascinating, cooperative hunting strategy called mud ringing. The crew, many of whom have filmed marine animals for decades, faced some unusual underwater challenges. How do you safely capture underwater footage of massive male humpbacks battling over a female? How can you smoothly track tiny, fast-moving reef residents like the cleaner wrasse? Filmmakers reveal their clever solutions. And while cinematographers experience many moments that take their breath away, a few assignments - including an eerie expedition into a coral reef catacomb and a nighttime dive with hundreds of hunting sharks - have the entire crew holding their breath. After three years in production, filmmakers are hopeful their quest will have a meaningful and lasting impact on audiences. They take one last trip, not featured in the final film, which illustrates how humans can positively impact our oceans and their incredible inhabitants long into the future.

Dolphin Reef;2018;Kids;78 min;'Animals & Nature', 'Documentary', 'Family';April 3, 2020;7.5;"A playful young dolphin named Echo must master his vital role in the coral reef community.                                        
                      Echo, a young Pacific bottlenose dolphin, seems far more interested in exploring his spectacular coral reef home, and its intriguing inhabitants, than learning to survive in it. He doesn’t comprehend that soon he will play a vital role in both his own survival and the survival of the colorful, living, breathing city that he and his family call home. The reef is an intricately balanced ecosystem in which each citizen contributes: from the millions of plants and creatures which inhabit the coral to the gardener fish that feed upon its lush growth to the predators – like Echo – that keep the fish population in check. At three years old, Echo has relied solely on his mother, Kumu, to feed and protect him. Now he’s weaned off mother’s milk and it’s time to catch his own meals and develop the essential skills needed to thrive in his underwater world. However, the teachings of his mother tend to go unnoticed by Echo, who’s distracted by more enjoyable pursuits. Echo often can be found balancing a shell upon his rostrom or investigating the many fascinating residents of the reef, such as the fastidious peacock mantis shrimp or the bumphead parrotfish, with a face only a mother could love. He’s particularly distracted by a 40-foot humpback whale and her newborn calf, who create a massive wake that’s hard to resist. As Echo gains more independence, he discovers that even a giant creature like the humpback whale has something to fear in the deep blue. The pod must sleep with one eye open – which, in fact, they do – with the ocean’s greatest hunter, the orca, nearby. These black-and-white behemoths prey upon bottlenose dolphins and whale calves. Even as predators themselves, the ocean contains numerous dangers for Echo and his family. They must also be wary of creatures such as the giant stingray, with its razor-sharp venomous tail, and the shark that even reef sharks fear: the tiger shark. But there’s power in numbers and Echo and his pod rely upon one another for safety and comfort. They’re a close-knit community, which communicates in a complex language of squeaks and clicks, and conveys reassurance through physical contact. The key to their survival is teamwork. Kumu is determined to make Echo a contributing member of the team and has been encouraging him to use echolocation, a highly sophisticated sonar, to find fish buried in the sand. Now it’s time for a master class. Mother and son set out on a journey to the pod’s favorite group hunting grounds, the legendary muddy shallows, where she’ll teach Echo her high-speed technique for corralling fish. If Echo can master this skill, he’ll become both self-sufficient and a valued member of the pod – a community that’s vital to the success of the reef and the health of our oceans worldwide.

                      African elephant Shani and her spirited son Jomo set out on an epic journey with their herd, traveling hundreds of miles across the vast Kalahari Desert, from the Okavango delta to the Zambezi River, just as countless generations of their ancestors have done before. Shani and her family are among the last elephants on earth to make these lengthy migrations. She’s mother to wide-eyed, one-year-old Jomo, who has yet to experience a migration, and at 40 years old, she is next in line as herd matriarch, a position currently held by her older sister Gaia. Gaia’s herd is among countless species – from hippopotamus to lechwe to baboons – that rely upon the life-giving water that flows from the mountains and transforms the heart of the desert into a green oasis known as the Okavango delta. But the season’s end is near and soon there will be a mass exodus. Nothing on Earth is more precious to life than water. And perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than the Kalahari desert in southern Africa, one of the driest places on the planet. The water is receding and paradise will soon turn to dust as the delta becomes a series of vanishing pools. Gaia instinctively knows she must lead the herd directly into the baking Kalahari desert, before the remaining water holes dry up. The herd’s success will depend on her experience and wisdom, which has been handed down over many generations. Just as the saying “an elephant never forgets” implies, these massive mammals have a deep connection to their past. Gaia will take her family down ancient elephant paths, networks of lines and circles – the circles being water holes the family will desperately need to cross the vast desert. Along the way, they’ll seek nourishment from sources such as moisture-rich mopane leaves and baobab tree trunks filled with rainwater. As they near their destination, the herd must cross the mighty Zambezi River to reach the safe haven for which they’ve been searching. They must enter the shallows, where crocodiles prey upon elephant calves like Jomo, and fight a ferocious current that could draw them into the world’s greatest waterfall, Victoria Falls. Fortunately, the herd has the strength and stamina to succeed and can rest while enjoying unlimited water and all the palm nuts they can shake from the trees. But within a few short months, food is scarce and the water begins its voyage back to the Okavango delta. The family must traverse the wilds of Africa, yet again. The march back to the delta will be no easy task, as the Angolan flood waters are early this year and the herd will need to make quick time. However, the emotional bonds between elephants are as strong as those between humans and the strength of family has gotten them this far. Together, Gaia, Shani, Jomo and family dare to take the shortest route … through lion country.

                      “In the Footsteps of Elephant” follows filmmakers as they capture the epic journey of African elephants across the Kalahari desert for Disneynature’s “Elephant.” The team faces extreme weather, inaccessible terrain, crocodile-infested waters and close encounters with lions in order to shine a light on these remarkable creatures and their ancient migrations. Filming the world’s largest terrestrial animal is no easy task. To embark on their 1,000-mile, round-trip adventure, the Disneynature team must first transport the crew, along with five tons of camera gear, to the heart of the Okavango Delta, a remote oasis where elephants gather annually. Their next challenge is finding elephants. And despite their incredible size, locating an elephant in an area that’s nearly 4,000 square miles is like finding a needle in a haystack. Fortunately for filmmakers, a local biologist who tracks elephant populations lends a hand. The team identifies its herd and it’s off the races … literally. A family of elephants can travel up to 30 miles a day on their quest to reach paradise and the crew simply can’t keep up. However, out of adversity comes opportunity. They mount a stabilized camera, normally used for aerial filming, to their truck and a whole new way of telling their story is born. Cinematographers are eager to capture a migration that’s never been shown before but filming in the African wilderness comes with its own unique set of risks. Crew members come face-to-face with crocodiles while drift diving, discover lions hunting impala in the middle of camp, and film a nighttime confrontation between a lion and a mother elephant and calf – from the open back of a truck. However, the rewards far outweigh the risks. Filmmakers reminisce about their favorite production moments. From the playful: a young calf splashing and chasing lechwes and egrets; to the poignant: an elephant herd honoring the bones of a fallen relative; to the awe-inspiring: a newborn elephant taking its first steps. After a year of filming, the team has fallen in love with the elephants, and all their unique and endearing eccentricities. When they return to where their journey began, they patiently, anxiously await the return of the herd.

                      “Togo” is the untold true story set in the winter of 1925 that takes you across the treacherous terrain of the Alaskan tundra for an exhilarating and uplifting adventure that will test the strength, courage and determination of one man, Leonhard Seppala, and his lead sled dog, Togo. When a deadly epidemic strikes the town of Nome, Alaska and the only cure is more than 600 miles away, the town looks to champion dogsled trainer Leonhard Seppala (Willem Dafoe) to help transport an antitoxin serum. Seppala turns to Togo, an unassuming, undersized and aging Siberian husky, to be his lead. His wife (Julianne Nicholson) has championed Togo since his days as a mischievous puppy who could dig himself out of any situation, literally and physically, and Seppala, having observed Togo’s loyalty and tenacious spirit, knows Togo offers his only chance of surviving this mission. Undaunted by the massive storm heading their way or pressure from his wife not to go, Seppala and Togo set out on the deadliest leg of what becomes a larger relay involving multiple mushers, facing gale force winds, 50 below zero temperatures and little to no visibility. It is an intense journey that causes the veteran musher to grasp the depth of his feelings for his lead dog and the unbreakable bond they share. Some flashing lights sequences or patterns may affect photosensitive viewers.

                      Sleeping Beauty tells the story of Princess Aurora and the evil curse placed on her by vengeful fairy Maleficent. According to the prophecy, Aurora will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a deep slumber on her 16th birthday, from which only the kiss of her true love can awaken her. Three doting fairies – Flora, Fauna and Merryweather – pose as peasant women to raise the young princess, whom they call Briar Rose, and live deep in the forest where Maleficent cannot find her. One day while riding in the woods, Prince Phillip catches sight of Briar Rose and the two fall in love at first sight. But Rose learns from the fairies that she is a princess and must return to the castle immediately to fulfill her royal duties. There, Maleficent discovers Aurora alone in the tower. The prince rushes to the castle to rescue Aurora, but first he must battle Maleficent, who assumes the form of a fierce, fire-spouting dragon.

His odds of success at such a simple aim keep getting worse because Colonel Cathcart keeps raising the number of missions the men have to fly. More than the retreating Germans, the real enemy for Yossarian and his rag-tag bunch of friends is the bureaucracy of the military, inverting logic at every turn. The pinnacle of this is Catch-22, a military by-law which states that if you fly your missions, you’re crazy, and don’t have to fly them; all you have to do is ask. But if you ask not to, then you’re sane, and so you have to fly them."
